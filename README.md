This repository contains a helper tool for [Deforum](https://github.com/deforum-art/deforum-stable-diffusion), a stable diffusion extension that allows users to create videos with the Stable Diffusion Image Generator AI. Deforum Helper assists users in writing camera animations on a timeline in Deforum and provides a visualization of the changes between frames.

- Click on a channel to expand the timeline for that channel.
- Activate/deactivate specific frames with on/off buttons inside each frame.
- Adjust frame values using the up-down buttons inside the frame.
